## 📌 Abstract

Urban traffic congestion contributes to increased travel time, air pollution, and road accidents. This project implements a data-driven approach using regression-based machine learning models to analyze and predict traffic volume. Our study concludes that the **AdaBoost Regressor** performs the best with:

- 📈 R² Score: `0.8042`
- ❌ Mean Absolute Error: `0.0397`
- 🔁 Mean Squared Error: `0.0053`

These results demonstrate that ML techniques, particularly ensemble methods, can be effectively leveraged for smart city traffic management.
